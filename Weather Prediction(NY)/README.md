# About The Data 
This Data is from National oceanic and atmospheric adminstration (NOAA) https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/search , which provides scientific stewardship, products, and services for geophysical data from the Sun to the Earth and Earthâ€™s sea floor and solid earth environment, including Earth observations from space 

Our Data covers the Duration from 1970 to 2022 inculding several predictors such as maximum temprature(TMAX) , minimum temprature(TMIN) & more.

# Objective
To predict The maximum temprature in the future based on the historical data.

# Steps and Procedure
### Preprocessing 
- NULL percentage of each col was calculated then We Dropped cols with NULL precentage greater than( > ) 5%
- Filled in missings with the previous NON_NULL value
- Correcting Data Types for our variables

### Model Used
- Analyzing the correlations among predictors, there was a siginficant association between most of them
- Choosing Ridge Regression with Parameter 0.1
- Excluding qualitative variables from the model
- Used backtest process to train & test the model

# Evaluation
- Mean error was almost 5 using mean absolute error metric
- Having added more predictiors the mean error decreased to 4
